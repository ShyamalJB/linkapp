To run the application go to "dist" folder and open "linkapp.exe" file. This might only run on Windows only.

There are three links:
1) Google
2) My Youtube Channel (musical one)
3) My Studio Instagram profile

Please let me know if it ran your Windows PC or not. Because it is my first GUI app that I pushed to GITHUB 😅
